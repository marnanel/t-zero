windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the blades, which are whirled
round in the wind and make the mill- stone turn.~^^~It is quite clear,~
replied Don Quixote, ~that you are not experienced in this matter of
adventures. They are giants, and if you are afraid, go away and say your
prayers, whilst I advance and engage them in fierce and unequal battle.~^^Thus
said, the knight engaged the nearest windmill in battle, thrusting his lance
into the blade. But the wind turned the blade with such violence, that it
shivered his weapon to pieces and dragged the injured knight rolling across
the plain.^^In conclusion, Don Quixote cried ~the same sage who robbed me of
my chamber and my books has metamorphosed those giants into windmills to cheat
me of the glory of vanquishing them. Such is the enmity he bears me; but in
the very end his black arts shall avail little against the goodness of my
sword.~^^~God grant it!~ answered Sancho.^^As you close the book, you think of
Count Zero and vow to tilt at any windmills he throws across your path."

into the following summary, voice-over courtesy of the Count:^^~The reptoids
are busily engaged in enacting Phase I of the construction. They serve my
purposes well--they nervously need some enterprise to occupy them but their
reptilian brains are unable to supply any activity of their own (other than
perhaps basking in the sun or flicking their tongues at flies). In addition,
they will have no successors and thus no collective memory to draw my deeds
down upon me. As soon as their task is complete, they will become extinct. A
well-aimed asteroid has already been tested and found its mark effortlessly
(causing a flurry of consternation amongst its future targets). And finally,
the reptoids are useful since they provide a conveniently frightening
mythology for my gargoylized future.^^~Phase I involves construction of the
Overseeing Obelisk and the Museum proper. A slight problem has arisen.
Prufrock has arrived through the portal and some how made off with all the
blueprints. He is benightedly under the delusion that if he changes a white
line on a blueprint he can somehow alter the future. Alas, I wish this were
so--my task would then become a lot easier. But, nevertheless, Prufrock's
taking off with the blueprints creates a slight problem. I must rely on the
myopic reptilian memories for the construction and fear slight flaws will be
introduced into the structure. Prufrock has retreated to the safe haven beyond
the river where my powers can't reach him. Let him be content with
crosshatching white lines on nothingness!~"

other two hefty volumes and you quickly paraphrase his words:^^~The groundwork
has been laid and now one must wait. This is an unremarkable period but a
necessary one, best rewarded by patience. The Obelisk continues it's unending
task of emanating rays that alter the fabric of time, slowly but steadily.
There is little need for my monitoring here so my forays into the Future
become more frequent. The toxic side-effects of the emanations are not yet
pronounced but a definite washout of reality is evident. I knew all along that
the environment must be sacrificed but I failed to consider the deleterious
effects on my precious poppies. Maybe I can still find some way to preserve
their inspiration over the ages. In addition, as the poppies go, so go my
butterflies.^^~The librarian, Prufrock, has disappeared into the Past. Who
keeps planting these one-way compasses in the pockets of my drones? The less
curious their nature, the better. For that reason, I've elevated a no-count
kid, currently performing custodial duties, to the stewardship of the library.

librarian's skill for searching, extracting, and summarizing:^^~The Future

in place. Even though each session yields only an infinitesimal spark,
amassing these sparks on a collective scale yields omniscience and
omnipotence. The toxicity of the environment creates a turbulent world I find
quite beautiful. To protect my pawns (after all they must remain alive--a
ruler without subjects is an oxymoron and a true moron at best), everything is
enclosed in transparent tubes which afford protection from as well as views of
the wild, new landscape. Alas, no poppies anymore, but I'm experimenting with
a blue fungus harvested by the spore farms. The Gargoyles keep everything
under control and the ClockWorks are in tune.~^^The discourse concludes: ~I've

custodial hours--you have no desire to carry it around."

! 0x25b94
         "You trace the patterns with your fingers. Of course, no image
adheres to your hand. If you want to retain an image, you'll have to find
another way."

your insides to stone."

         "You can't encompass a cavern!"

! 0x25e10
         "Your habit of picking up everything that isn't nailed down is a sign

! 0x26002
         "The spindle is firmly embedded in the desk."

! 0x2601e
         "Your hand comes away wet."

! 0x26032
         "You've already had quite enough of yourself, thank you."

! 0x261ba
         "The rod is set firmly in place."

! 0x261d2
         "You ponder weightily for a moment and decide not to take the
scales."

! 0x26206
         "You hatch yet another harebrained scheme."

! 0x26226
         "You might read the _var_0 instead."

! 0x26240
         "There is nothing there."

they'll stay."

         "The shrinking violets are deathly afraid of being picked up. They
shy away from your touch."

! 0x2644c
         "You stop trying as your hands begin to strip bare."

! 0x2646c
         "You're lucky the blades aren't moving! Otherwise, they could easily
hoe you down."

! 0x2664e
         "The monkey scampers away from you."

! 0x2666e
         "You've got as good a grip on it as you're going to get."

         "The sand is inside the eggtimer."

! 0x2680c
         "You decide that the guardrail is a necessary precaution and let it
be."

! 0x26844
         "Sorry, the slot won't accept your fingers--apparently your
fingerprints are not minted with the image the machine accepts."

! 0x2689c
         "You slide down the sloping ramp. Apparently, you're not inclined
that way."

! 0x268d6
         "Sorry, it hasn't been released yet."

! 0x268f4
         "You reach for the sky but you're not that high."

! 0x26918

_var_9 against your skin."
